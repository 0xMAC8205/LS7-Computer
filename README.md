# Note
In this GitHub Repo, there will only be
PDF's etc.

The whole project is avaiable on 'OSHWLab' to edit on EasyEda
> https://oshwlab.com/gabrielweingardt/LS7-Computer

# Code
Code for this system can be found in
> https://github.com/0xMAC8205/LS7-Kernel

There, I develop the Kernel, wich will be used
in the Operating System, that follows.

There, I also put test programs, to help with
on-device developement.

(A Lot of Fixes and Bodge-Wires) ^^ but all in all very stable

**Back view of IO Ports**

May put a bit more space between the expansion slots and power jack

**Keyboard**

May remove the "ALT" key, replacing it with an Escape/Reset Key or a Character Key

**Important note**

This Version, you're seeing is just a personal prototype board. I do not recommend anyone to use this PCB Layout.
It contains a few errors that have been fixxed in the Schematic, but not PCB.

I'm changing the PCB Layout anyway and adding a few more features. This is just a development step
